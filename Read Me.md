This python code is used to reformat SEC output data from an AKTA system for plotting in Excel/Graphpad Prism.

Even for runs using the same protocol, the AKTA doesn't always save ouput data with the same mL increments. Normalize_Data.py spaces the values appropriately such that runs can be plotted together.
Export the waveforms from the UNICORN software suite as a .asc file. Open it locally and save the file as an excel file.
